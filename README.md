Trivia Bouncy House Game
Multi-user Trivia Game

This project will extend the Trivia Game homework assignment to a competitive multiplayer game that offers a choice of categories and difficulty levels. Player names and scores will be held in pesistant storage and displayed as a leader board which will display user names and high scores.

Scoring will be based on the number right answers selected, difficulty of questions and time taken to answer questions.
    
When the user completes a quiz, they will be prompted to enter in his/her initials at that point the users current game score will be posted to the leaderboards and displayed alongside the entered initial.

Users will play against the machine. However, the leader board will provide the competitive element, as users try to rack up the highest score.
