Idea #2 -- Multi-user Trivia Game

This project will extend the Trivia Game homework assignment to a competitive game that offers a choice of categories and difficulty levels. It will have a leader board. 
	Scoring will be based on number right, difficulty of questions and (possibly) time taken to answer questions.
	We will offer sounds to make the experience more like an arcade game.
	When user accesses the game, user will be asked to login with preferred name This name (or initials) will be used to record game outcome and populate leader board.
		Possibly user can select and store an avatar which will be associated and displayed.
	Bells and whistles will be key to making the user experience like that of an arcade game.
	User will play against the machine. However, the leader board will provide the competitive element, as users try to rack up the highest score.
